üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues
1. MongoDB Connection Error
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
Solution: Make sure MongoDB is running on your system.

2. JWT Secret Error
Error: JWT_SECRET is not defined
Solution: Make sure you have created the .env file with the JWT_SECRET variable.

3. File Upload Not Working
Check:

File format is CSV, XLSX, or XLS
File size is under 10MB
CSV has the correct headers (FirstName, Phone, Notes)
4. Frontend Can't Connect to Backend
Check:

Backend server is running on port 5000
Frontend .env.local has correct NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
No firewall blocking the ports
Reset Application
# Stop all servers
# Delete uploads folder (backend)
rm -rf backend/uploads

# Reset database (if using local MongoDB)
mongo
use mern_task_distribution
db.dropDatabase()

# Recreate admin user
cd backend
node createAdmin.js
